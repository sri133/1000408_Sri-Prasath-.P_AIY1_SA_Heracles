📌 Project Overview

Many youth athletes do not have access to professional coaching or personalized training plans.
This project solves that by building a Generative AI-based coaching assistant that:

Creates position-specific workout plans

Adjusts training for injury history

Provides safe muscle gain / fat loss routines

Suggests nutrition guidance based on diet type

Promotes structured and sustainable development

The assistant is safety-focused and avoids extreme or medical advice.
